🐾 Wildlife Observation Dashboard – Power BI Project
📌 Project Overview
This is my first Power BI dashboard project, designed to track and analyze wildlife observation data.
The goal of this dashboard is to showcase my skills in data cleaning, modeling, visualization, and insight generation.

🎯 Key Objectives
Track wildlife observations by species, location, and time

Compare average body size and weight across different animal types

Visualize geographical distribution of observations

Analyze gender distribution of observed animals

Create an interactive and visually consistent dashboard

📊 Dashboard Highlights
1️⃣ Monthly Trend of Wildlife Observations
Tracks changes in observation frequency month-over-month

Helps identify seasonal trends in animal sightings

2️⃣ Average Body Size & Weight by Animal Type
Compares average length and average weight

Includes key species such as European Bison, Lynx, Hedgehog, and Red Squirrel

3️⃣ Observation Count by Country & Animal Type
Shows species distribution across different countries

Highlights top observation countries like Poland, Germany, and Hungary

4️⃣ Geographical Distribution of Observations
Interactive map visualization to view sightings by location

5️⃣ Gender Distribution of Observed Animals
Displays male, female, and unknown gender proportions

📈 Insights from the Data
European Bison was the most frequently observed animal

Poland had the highest number of wildlife observations

Observation counts peaked in March 2024

Male and female observations are almost evenly split

Small species like the Hedgehog still had notable tracking presence
